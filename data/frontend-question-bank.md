A) `<!DOCTYPE HTML5>` B) `<!DOCTYPE html>` C) `<html doctype>` D) `<!HTML>`
Answer: B — `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser to render in standards mode.

Q3. What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?
A) No difference B) Block elements start on a new line and take full width; inline elements flow within content and only take necessary width C) Inline elements are larger D) Block elements are for text only
Answer: B — div, p, h1-h6 are block. span, a, strong, em are inline.

Q4. What is the purpose of the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag?
A) Sets the page title B) Declares the character encoding so the browser correctly renders text including special characters C) Links a stylesheet D) Sets the viewport
Answer: B — UTF-8 supports virtually all characters in all languages.

Q5. What is the `alt` attribute on an image used for?
A) Alternative styling B) Providing text description for screen readers, SEO, and display when the image fails to load C) An image title D) Image dimensions
Answer: B — Alt text is critical for accessibility and is required for valid HTML.

Q6. What is semantic HTML?
A) HTML with JavaScript B) Using HTML elements that carry meaning about the content they contain, improving accessibility and SEO C) HTML with CSS D) HTML comments
Answer: B — Examples: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`.

Q7. What is the difference between `<strong>` and `<b>`?
A) No difference B) `<strong>` indicates semantic importance; `<b>` is purely presentational bold without semantic meaning C) `<b>` is deprecated D) `<strong>` is for titles
Answer: B — Use `<strong>` when the content is important; use `<b>` purely for visual styling.

Q8. What is the difference between `<em>` and `<i>`?
A) No difference B) `<em>` indicates stressed emphasis with semantic meaning; `<i>` is purely presentational italic C) `<i>` is deprecated D) `<em>` is for titles

Q9. What does the `data-*` attribute do?
A) Links to a database B) Stores custom data on HTML elements accessible via JavaScript, without using non-standard attributes C) Adds metadata D) Links data files
Answer: B — `data-user-id="123"` accessed via `element.dataset.userId`.

Q10. What is the difference between `<script>` placed in `<head>` vs end of `<body>`?
A) No difference B) In head it blocks HTML parsing; at end of body it loads after the page content, improving perceived performance C) Head is always better D) Body placement breaks CSS
Answer: B — Or use `defer`/`async` attributes to control loading behavior.

Q11. What is the `defer` attribute on a script tag?
A) Delays the script forever B) Downloads the script in parallel with HTML parsing but executes it after the document is fully parsed C) Executes immediately D) Same as async

Answer: required

Q18. The ________ HTML element creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, or any URL.
Answer: `<a>` (anchor)

Q19. The ________ element is used to group table header cells, providing semantic meaning and default bold centered styling.
Answer: `<th>`

Q20. HTML ________ are metadata elements in the `<head>` providing information about the document to browsers and search engines.
Answer: meta tags

Q21. The ________ attribute on a form input creates a label-like placeholder text inside the input that disappears when typing begins.
Answer: placeholder

Q22. The ________ element represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently, like an article, blog post, or forum post.

Q24. The ________ attribute on an anchor tag opens the linked document in a new tab.
Answer: `target="_blank"`

Q25. The ________ element represents a thematic group of content, typically with a heading.
Answer: `<section>`

### Scenario

Q26. You need to build a navigation menu that is accessible to screen reader users. What HTML structure do you use?
Answer: Use a `<nav>` element wrapping an unordered list. Add `aria-label="Main navigation"` on the nav element to distinguish it from other nav elements. Use `<a>` tags for all links. For the current page link, add `aria-current="page"`. For dropdown menus, use `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, and manage focus with JavaScript. For mobile hamburger menus, add `aria-controls` linking the button to the menu it controls, and toggle `aria-expanded` on button click. Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable (tab order) and visible focus indicators are present. Use `role="menubar"` and `role="menuitem"` for complex multi-level menus per the ARIA authoring practices guide.

Q27. A designer gives you a form with 15 fields. How do you structure the HTML for maximum usability and accessibility?
Answer: Group related fields using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`. Associate every label with its input using `<label for="inputId">` or wrapping. Use appropriate input types (email, tel, number, date) for mobile keyboard optimization and native validation. Add `required` to mandatory fields. Use `aria-describedby` to link error messages and hints to their fields. Use `autocomplete` attributes (name, email, street-address) for autofill support. Add `aria-invalid="true"` and descriptive error messages on validation failure. Group submit and reset buttons at the bottom. Use `<progress>` indicators for multi-step forms. Ensure tab order follows visual reading order.

## TOPIC 2: CSS FUNDAMENTALS

### Concept MCQ

Q28. What is the CSS box model?
A) A 3D model B) The model describing how elements are rendered with content, padding, border, and margin layers C) A CSS framework D) A layout model
Answer: B — Understanding the box model is fundamental to CSS layout.

Q29. What is the difference between `box-sizing: content-box` and `box-sizing: border-box`?
A) No difference B) content-box: width/height applies to content only; border-box: width/height includes padding and border — making sizing much more predictable C) border-box adds margin D) content-box includes padding
Answer: B — Most developers apply `* { box-sizing: border-box }` globally.

Q30. What is CSS specificity?
A) How specific CSS selectors are B) A weight system determining which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element — inline > ID > class > element C) CSS priority D) CSS inheritance
Answer: B — Specificity is calculated as (inline, ID, class/pseudo-class/attribute, element/pseudo-element).

Q31. What is the CSS cascade?
A) A waterfall effect B) The algorithm determining which CSS declaration applies when multiple declarations target the same property — considering origin, importance, specificity, and source order C) CSS animation D) CSS inheritance
Answer: B — The cascade is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.

Q32. What is CSS inheritance?
A) Child elements copying parent styling B) Some CSS properties automatically passed from parent to child elements (font-family, color) while others are not (margin, padding, border) C) CSS specificity D) Cascading rules
Answer: B — Use `inherit`, `initial`, `unset` keywords to explicitly control inheritance.

Q33. What is the difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`?
A) No difference B) `display: none` removes the element from layout entirely; `visibility: hidden` hides it visually but it still takes up space C) Both remove from layout D) visibility is deprecated
Answer: B — `opacity: 0` makes it invisible but still interactive; `visibility: hidden` makes it invisible and non-interactive.

Q34. What is a CSS pseudo-class?
A) A fake class B) A keyword added to a selector applying styles to elements in a specific state — :hover, :focus, :nth-child(), :not() C) A class attribute D) A CSS variable
Answer: B — Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state or position.

Q35. What is a CSS pseudo-element?
A) A fake element B) A keyword creating a virtual element that does not exist in the DOM — ::before, ::after, ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::placeholder C) A pseudo-class D) An HTML element
Answer: B — `::before` and `::after` require a `content` property to render.

Q36. What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?
A) No difference B) `em` is relative to the font-size of the current element; `rem` is relative to the root element's font-size (html element) — rem is more predictable C) em is absolute D) rem is deprecated
Answer: B — rem avoids the compounding problem of nested em values.

Q37. What is a CSS variable (custom property)?
A) A JavaScript variable B) A value defined with `--name: value` on an element and referenced with `var(--name)`, scoped to that element and its descendants C) A preprocessor feature D) A media query
Answer: B — CSS variables cascade and can be updated with JavaScript: `element.style.setProperty('--color', 'red')`.

Q38. What is the `position: sticky` value?
A) An absolute position B) An element that is positioned relative until a scroll threshold is reached, then behaves as fixed relative to its scroll container C) A fixed position D) A relative position
Answer: B — Commonly used for table headers and sticky navigation within content sections.

Q39. What is the `z-index` property?
A) A zoom index B) Controls the stacking order of positioned elements along the z-axis — higher values appear in front C) A CSS variable D) A layout property
Answer: B — z-index only works on positioned elements (position other than static).

Q40. What is a CSS stacking context?
A) A z-index value B) A conceptual layer created by certain CSS properties (position + z-index, opacity < 1, transform, filter) within which child elements are stacked relative to each other C) A z-index hierarchy D) CSS layers
Answer: B — Understanding stacking contexts is essential for debugging z-index issues.

Q41. What is the `will-change` CSS property?
A) Future CSS changes B) Hints to the browser which properties will animate, allowing it to optimize by creating a compositor layer in advance C) A transition property D) A performance hack
Answer: B — Use sparingly — it increases memory usage. Apply only to elements that will actually animate.

Q42. What is `contain` CSS property?
A) Overflow containment B) Tells the browser an element's subtree is independent from the rest of the page, enabling rendering optimizations C) A layout property D) Box sizing
Answer: B — `contain: layout paint` prevents layout recalculations from propagating.

### Concept MCQ

Q53. What is Flexbox?
A) A JavaScript library B) A CSS layout model providing a one-dimensional layout system (row or column) for distributing space and aligning items C) A CSS framework D) A grid system
Answer: B — Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts and component-level alignment.

Q54. What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox?
A) No difference B) `justify-content` aligns items along the main axis (row direction); `align-items` aligns items along the cross axis (column direction) C) Both do the same D) They apply to grid only
Answer: B — Main axis direction is set by `flex-direction`.

Q55. What does `flex: 1` shorthand mean?
A) One flex item B) `flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%` — the item grows to fill available space equally C) Fixed width D) Minimum size
Answer: B — `flex: 1` is the most common shorthand for equal-space-filling items.

Q56. What is `align-self` in Flexbox?
A) Self-centering B) Overrides the container's `align-items` for a specific flex item, controlling its cross-axis alignment individually C) Self-sizing D) Self-ordering
Answer: B — Useful when one item needs different alignment than its siblings.

Q57. What is CSS Grid?
A) A table layout B) A two-dimensional CSS layout system enabling control over both rows and columns simultaneously C) A flexbox variant D) A CSS framework
Answer: B — Grid is ideal for page-level layouts and two-dimensional component arrangements.

Q58. What is the `fr` unit in CSS Grid?
A) A fraction of the font B) A fractional unit representing a fraction of available space in the grid container after fixed sizes are subtracted C) A fixed pixel D) A flexible rem
Answer: B — `grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr` creates three columns where the middle is twice as wide.

Q59. What does `grid-template-areas` allow you to do?
A) Name grid items B) Define a visual layout using named areas — reference these names in `grid-area` on individual items for an intuitive layout description C) Set template sizes D) Define grid rows
Answer: B — Makes complex layouts readable and maintainable.

Q60. What is `minmax()` in CSS Grid?
A) A math function B) A function setting a minimum and maximum size for a grid track — `minmax(200px, 1fr)` means "at least 200px but grow if space allows" C) A clamp function D) A media query
Answer: B — Enables responsive grids without media queries.

Q61. What is `auto-fill` vs `auto-fit` in CSS Grid?
A) No difference B) Both fill rows with as many columns as possible; `auto-fill` creates empty tracks at the end; `auto-fit` collapses empty tracks so existing items expand C) auto-fill is deprecated D) auto-fit creates fixed columns
Answer: B — Used with `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))` for responsive grids.

Q62. When should you use Flexbox vs Grid?
A) Always use Grid B) Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts (a row of items or a column); Grid for two-dimensional layouts needing row and column control simultaneously C) Always use Flexbox D) They are equivalent
Answer: B — They complement each other and are often used together.

### Fill in the Blank

Q63. The CSS property ________ defines the main axis direction of a flex container — row or column.
Answer: flex-direction

Q64. ________ controls whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
Answer: flex-wrap

Q65. The Grid shorthand ________ defines both rows and columns in one declaration.
Answer: grid-template (or grid-template: rows / columns)

Q66. The ________ property on a grid item specifies which row lines it spans from and to.
Answer: grid-row (or grid-row-start / grid-row-end)

Q67. ________ is a CSS Grid feature placing items automatically into the next available cell, controlled by the `grid-auto-flow` property.
Answer: Auto-placement

Q68. The CSS ________ function creates a responsive grid with as many columns as fit, each at least a minimum size.
Answer: repeat(auto-fill, minmax())

Q69. ________ in Flexbox specifies the initial main size of a flex item before free space distribution.
Answer: flex-basis

Q70. The ________ property in Grid places a named grid area shorthand spanning rows and columns.
Answer: grid-area

### Scenario

Q71. You need to center a div both horizontally and vertically inside its parent. Give three CSS solutions.
Answer: Solution 1 — Flexbox: parent gets `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center`. Solution 2 — Grid: parent gets `display: grid; place-items: center`. Solution 3 — Absolute positioning: child gets `position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` with parent `position: relative`. Solution 4 (modern): `position: absolute; inset: 0; margin: auto` with a defined width/height on the child. Flexbox and Grid solutions are the most maintainable. The absolute positioning approach is useful when the parent cannot be a flex/grid container.

Q72. Design a responsive card grid that shows 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, and 3 on desktop using CSS Grid.
Answer: `.card-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 1rem; }` then `@media (min-width: 600px) { .card-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); } }` and `@media (min-width: 900px) { .card-grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); } }`. Or with no media queries using auto-fill: `.card-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; }` — this automatically creates as many columns as fit, achieving the same result responsively without breakpoints.

Answer: B — Coined by Ethan Marcotte; foundational to modern web development.

Q74. What is a viewport meta tag and why is it essential?
A) Sets page title B) `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` instructs mobile browsers to use the device width rather than a virtual 980px viewport C) Links stylesheets D) Sets character encoding
Answer: B — Without it, mobile browsers zoom out to show the full desktop-width page.

Q75. What is mobile-first design?
A) Designing for mobile users only B) Starting CSS design for the smallest screens and progressively enhancing for larger screens using min-width media queries C) A framework approach D) Removing desktop features
Answer: B — Mobile-first produces leaner CSS and naturally prioritizes core content and performance.

Q76. What is the difference between min-width and max-width in media queries?
A) No difference B) min-width applies styles from a breakpoint upward (mobile-first); max-width applies styles from a breakpoint downward (desktop-first) C) max-width is deprecated D) min-width is for fonts only
Answer: B — Mobile-first uses min-width; desktop-first uses max-width.

Q77. What is fluid typography?
A) Animated text B) Typography that scales smoothly between a minimum and maximum size based on viewport width, using `clamp()` or `vw` units C) Responsive font loading D) Variable fonts
Answer: B — `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem)` — min, preferred, max.

Q78. What are common responsive design breakpoints?
A) Fixed pixel values B) Viewport widths where layouts shift — commonly around 480px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (small desktop), 1280px (large desktop) though content should guide breakpoints C) Fixed device sizes D) CSS framework sizes
Answer: B — Better approach: let content determine breakpoints, not specific devices.

Q79. What is the difference between adaptive and responsive design?
A) No difference B) Responsive uses fluid, percentage-based layouts adapting smoothly; adaptive uses fixed layouts for specific detected device widths C) Adaptive is newer D) Responsive is server-side
Answer: B — Responsive is the dominant modern approach; adaptive was common in early mobile web development.

Q80. What is `clamp()` in CSS?
A) A JavaScript method B) A CSS function taking minimum, preferred, and maximum values — `clamp(min, preferred, max)` — the value is constrained between min and max C) A flexbox property D) A grid function
Answer: B — Enables fluid sizing without media queries.

### Fill in the Blank

## TOPIC 5: JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTALS

### Concept MCQ

Q86. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
A) No difference B) `var` is function-scoped and hoisted; `let` is block-scoped; `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned C) `const` cannot change D) `var` is deprecated
Answer: B — Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed, avoid `var`.

Q87. What is hoisting in JavaScript?
A) Moving code to a server B) JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code executes — `var` declarations and function declarations are hoisted C) A scope mechanism D) Variable assignment
Answer: B — `var` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`. `let` and `const` are hoisted but in a temporal dead zone.

Q88. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
A) No difference B) `==` performs type coercion before comparison; `===` checks value and type without coercion — always prefer `===` C) `===` is slower D) `==` is more strict
Answer: B — `1 == "1"` is true; `1 === "1"` is false.

Q89. What is a closure in JavaScript?
A) A closed loop B) A function that retains access to its outer scope's variables even after the outer function has returned C) A class method D) A module
Answer: B — Closures are fundamental to data encapsulation, module patterns, and callbacks.

Q90. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
A) A for loop for events B) The mechanism allowing JavaScript's single thread to handle asynchronous operations by processing the call stack, microtask queue, and macrotask queue C) An event handler D) A DOM event
Answer: B — The event loop enables non-blocking I/O in a single-threaded environment.

Q91. What is the difference between the call stack, microtask queue, and macrotask queue?
A) All the same B) Call stack: synchronous code execution. Microtask queue: Promise callbacks, runs after each task before rendering. Macrotask queue: setTimeout, setInterval, processed one per event loop iteration C) All are asynchronous D) Macrotasks run first
Answer: B — Microtasks always drain completely before the next macrotask runs.

Q92. What is a Promise?
A) A commitment B) An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an async operation, with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` handlers C) A callback D) An async function
Answer: B — Promises replaced callback hell as the standard for async JavaScript.

Q93. What is `async/await`?
A) Two different things B) Syntactic sugar over Promises — `async` marks a function as asynchronous; `await` pauses execution until a Promise resolves, enabling synchronous-looking async code C) A new async model D) Synchronous code
Answer: B — `async/await` makes asynchronous code more readable without changing the underlying Promise mechanism.

Q94. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
A) No difference B) `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned; `null` is an explicit assignment indicating the intentional absence of a value C) Both are falsy only D) `null` is an error
Answer: B — `typeof null === 'object'` is a historical JavaScript bug.

Q95. What is prototypal inheritance?
A) Class-based inheritance B) JavaScript's inheritance model where objects inherit directly from other objects via a prototype chain — each object has a `__proto__` link to its prototype C) A design pattern D) An ES6 feature
Answer: B — ES6 `class` syntax is syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.

Q96. What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
A) The current file B) A context-dependent keyword referring to the object a function was called on — its value depends on how and where the function is called C) A global variable D) A class reference
Answer: B — Arrow functions do not have their own `this` — they inherit from the enclosing lexical scope.

Q97. What is the spread operator?
A) A multiplication operator B) `...` — expands an iterable (array, object) into individual elements — used for array/object copying, merging, and function arguments C) A rest parameter D) A destructuring operator
Answer: B — `[...arr1, ...arr2]` merges arrays. `{...obj1, ...obj2}` merges objects.

Q98. What is destructuring in JavaScript?
A) Breaking objects B) Extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables with concise syntax C) A spread operator D) A rest parameter
Answer: B — `const { name, age } = user;` and `const [first, second] = arr;`.

Q99. What are JavaScript modules?
A) npm packages B) Files that export and import functionality — ES modules use `export`/`import` syntax; each module has its own scope C) JavaScript classes D) Node.js only
Answer: B — ES modules are now supported natively in modern browsers.

Q100. What is the difference between `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`?
A) No difference B) forEach: iterate without returning. map: transform each element into a new array. filter: return subset matching a condition. reduce: accumulate to a single value C) All return arrays D) forEach returns a new array
Answer: B — Understanding these functional array methods is essential for modern JavaScript.

### Fill in the Blank

Q101. ________ is a JavaScript method returning a new Promise that resolves when all passed Promises resolve, or rejects when any one rejects.
Answer: Promise.all()

Q102. The ________ operator returns the value on its left if it is not null/undefined, otherwise the value on its right.
Answer: Nullish coalescing (??)

Q103. Optional chaining ________ accesses a property or calls a method, returning undefined instead of throwing if the left side is null/undefined.
Answer: ?. (optional chaining operator)

Q104. ________ is a JavaScript method copying object properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
Answer: Object.assign() (or spread operator)

Q105. The ________ method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a function on every element.
Answer: Array.prototype.map()

Q106. ________ is a JavaScript array method that tests whether at least one element passes the provided test function.
Answer: Array.prototype.some()

Q107. ________ is JavaScript's mechanism for converting objects to JSON strings and back.
Answer: JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()

Q108. The ________ event fires when the initial HTML is fully loaded and parsed, before stylesheets and images finish loading.
Answer: DOMContentLoaded

Q109. ________ is a JavaScript technique delaying function execution until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call.
Answer: Debouncing

Q110. ________ is a JavaScript technique ensuring a function executes at most once per specified time interval.
Answer: Throttling

### Scenario

Q111. Explain how you would implement a debounce function from scratch in JavaScript.
Answer:
```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
// Usage: const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchAPI, 300);
// input.addEventListener('input', debouncedSearch);
```
Every time the returned function is called, it clears the previous timer and sets a new one. The original function only executes if no new call arrives within the delay period. Commonly used for search inputs, window resize handlers, and form validation.

Q112. You notice a memory leak in a React-like component. It adds an event listener but never removes it. How do you fix this in vanilla JavaScript?
Answer: Always pair addEventListener with removeEventListener in cleanup. Store the handler reference so it can be removed:
```javascript
function setupComponent(element) {
  function handleClick(e) { /* ... */ }
  element.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
  // Return cleanup function
  return function cleanup() {
    element.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
  };
}
const cleanup = setupComponent(myElement);
// Later when component unmounts:
cleanup();
```
Also clean up: timers (clearTimeout, clearInterval), Intersection/Resize Observer disconnects, AbortControllers for fetch requests, and WebSocket connections. Memory leaks accumulate in single-page applications where components mount and unmount frequently.

Answer: B — Generics provide reusability without sacrificing type safety.

Q165. What is the TypeScript `unknown` type vs `any`?
A) No difference B) `any` disables type checking entirely; `unknown` is the type-safe counterpart — you must type-check before operating on an `unknown` value C) unknown is deprecated D) any is stricter
Answer: B — Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown — it forces proper type checking.

Q166. What is a union type in TypeScript?
A) Combining all types B) A type that can be one of several types: `string | number | boolean` — the variable can hold any of the specified types C) A class union D) An enum

A) Object keys B) A type operator producing a union of all key names of a given type: `type Keys = keyof User` produces `'name' | 'age' | 'email'` C) Object.keys() D) An index type
Answer: B — Used with mapped types to create transformations over object types.

Q170. What are TypeScript utility types?
A) Utility functions B) Built-in generic types transforming other types — Partial<T>, Required<T>, Readonly<T>, Pick<T,K>, Omit<T,K>, Record<K,V>, ReturnType<F> C) Type aliases D) Interface extensions

Q179. What is a React hook?
A) A lifecycle method B) A function letting functional components use React features — state (useState), effects (useEffect), context (useContext), and custom reusable logic C) A class method D) A prop type
Answer: B — Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and replaced most class component patterns.

Q180. What is `useState`?
A) A global state B) A hook returning a state variable and a setter function — `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` — re-renders the component when state changes C) A context D) A reducer
Answer: B — Always use the setter function; never mutate state directly.

Q181. What is `useEffect`?
A) A side-effect library B) A hook running a function after every render (or on specific dependency changes) for side effects — data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation C) A lifecycle method D) An event handler
Answer: B — Return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

Q182. What is the dependency array in `useEffect`?
A) A list of dependencies B) The second argument controlling when the effect runs — empty array `[]` runs once on mount, specific values `[id]` run when those values change, omitted runs after every render C) Optional metadata D) Import list
Answer: B — Wrong dependencies cause stale closures or infinite render loops.

Q183. What is `useMemo`?
A) A memory hook B) A hook caching the result of an expensive computation, recomputing only when dependencies change — prevents recalculation on every render C) A component cache D) A state optimizer
Answer: B — Use for expensive calculations, not for every value — premature optimization is costly.

Q184. What is `useCallback`?
A) A callback hook B) A hook memoizing a function reference, returning the same function instance unless dependencies change — prevents unnecessary child re-renders when passing callbacks as props C) A function cache D) An event hook
Answer: B — Use with `React.memo` to prevent child re-renders caused by new function references.

A) A memory utility B) A higher-order component that memoizes a component's rendered output, skipping re-render if props have not changed (shallow comparison) C) A hook D) A context
Answer: B — Use for pure components receiving stable props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Q186. What is the Context API?
A) A global variable B) React's built-in solution for sharing state across the component tree without prop drilling — `createContext`, `Provider`, `useContext` C) A state manager D) A routing solution
Answer: B — For complex state, combine with useReducer or use a dedicated state library.

Q187. What is `useReducer`?
A) A Redux hook B) A hook managing complex state logic — takes a reducer function and initial state, returns current state and dispatch function — similar to Redux locally C) A state array D) A context hook
Answer: B — Prefer `useReducer` over `useState` when state logic involves multiple sub-values or complex transitions.

Q188. What is `useRef`?
A) A reference to a hook B) A hook returning a mutable object with a `current` property — persists between renders without triggering re-renders. Used for DOM access and storing mutable values C) A state reference D) An imperative hook
Answer: B — `ref.current` accessing a DOM node does not trigger re-render.

Q189. What is React reconciliation?
A) A conflict resolution B) The algorithm React uses to compare previous and current virtual DOM trees and determine the minimal set of DOM operations to update the UI C) A diffing algorithm D) Both B and C
Answer: D — Reconciliation is the process; diffing is the algorithm within it.

Q190. What are React keys and why are they important?
A) Object keys B) Unique identifiers on list items helping React identify which items changed, were added, or removed — enabling efficient reconciliation without re-rendering unchanged items C) Event keys D) CSS keys
Answer: B — Use stable unique IDs as keys, not array indices (indices cause bugs with reordering).

Answer: useImperativeHandle

Q200. ________ is React's built-in solution for catching JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree.
Answer: Error Boundary (class component with componentDidCatch)

### Scenario

Q201. Your React component re-renders too frequently, causing performance issues. How do you diagnose and fix it?
Answer: Diagnosis: use React DevTools Profiler to identify which components re-render and why. Check the "why did this render?" feature showing which props/state changed. Common causes and fixes: parent re-renders passing new object/array/function references each time — wrap with useMemo/useCallback. Context value changing on every render — memoize the context value object with useMemo. Component receiving unstable props — use React.memo with a custom comparison function. State updates causing entire tree to re-render — split context into multiple contexts for different concerns, or move state closer to where it is used. Unnecessary useEffect dependencies — audit dependency arrays carefully. For expensive renders: virtualize long lists with react-window or react-virtual.

Q202. How do you handle data fetching in React in 2024?
Answer: Modern approaches: React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR for client-side fetching — they handle caching, background refetching, loading/error states, deduplication, and stale-while-revalidate patterns. For React 18+, use Suspense-compatible data fetching. For server components (Next.js), fetch data directly in server components without useEffect — data is fetched on the server, not the client. Avoid raw useEffect for data fetching in new code — it has many footguns (race conditions, no caching, manual loading state). If raw useEffect is necessary, implement cleanup with AbortController to cancel in-flight requests when the component unmounts or dependencies change.

Answer: B — Jotai and Recoil both use the atomic model popularized by Facebook's Recoil.

Q207. What is the difference between local state, server state, and global state?
A) All the same B) Local state: component-specific UI state. Server state: async data from APIs (React Query handles this). Global state: app-wide data like user auth (Redux/Zustand/Context) C) All need Redux D) Global state is always Redux
Answer: B — Not all state needs to be global — most should be as local as possible.

Q208. What is the flux architecture pattern?
A) A CSS pattern B) A unidirectional data flow pattern: View dispatches Actions → Dispatcher sends to Stores → Stores update → Views re-render. Redux is based on Flux principles C) An MVC variant D) A React pattern
Answer: B — Flux's one-way data flow makes state changes predictable and debuggable.

Q209. What is a Redux selector?
A) A CSS selector B) A function extracting specific data from the Redux store — memoized selectors (reselect) prevent unnecessary recomputations when state changes C) An action creator D) A reducer
Answer: B — `const selectUserName = state => state.user.name`.

## TOPIC 21: INTERVIEW SCENARIOS — ADVANCED FRONTEND

Q341. You notice your Next.js app's Time to First Byte (TTFB) is consistently over 2 seconds. How do you diagnose and fix it?
Answer: TTFB measures server response time. Diagnose: use Chrome DevTools Network tab filtering for the HTML document — check waiting time. Use WebPageTest for server-side timing breakdown. Causes and fixes: database queries in getServerSideProps — add caching (Redis), optimize queries, use database connection pooling. Server compute: move heavy processing to build time (SSG/ISR) or a background job. No caching: add Cache-Control headers, use edge caching (Vercel/Cloudflare CDN). Server cold starts: if using serverless functions, implement warm-up strategies. Geographic distance: deploy to edge locations closer to users. If data does not change per request, switch from SSR to ISR or SSG entirely — often the best fix.

Q342. A React application has a laggy input field when a user types in it. How do you diagnose and fix this?
Answer: Input lag means the main thread is blocked during keystroke processing. Diagnose: open Chrome DevTools Performance tab, record while typing, identify long tasks (> 50ms) blocking the main thread. Common causes: expensive re-renders triggered by state updates on every keystroke — the entire parent tree is re-rendering. Fixes: ensure only the input component re-renders (move state down, use React.memo on siblings). Debounce expensive operations triggered by input (search queries, validation) but not the input value itself. Use `useTransition` to mark non-urgent state updates as transitions, keeping the input responsive. Move heavy computation to a Web Worker. Avoid layout-triggering DOM reads in event handlers. Fix CSS: complex box-shadow or filter animations on the input itself can cause GPU layer thrashing.

Q343. How would you implement infinite scroll in React without causing performance issues?
Answer: Implementation: use IntersectionObserver to detect when a sentinel element at the bottom of the list comes into view, triggering a data fetch. Update state by appending new items to the existing array. Performance: use virtual scrolling (react-virtual or react-window) to render only visible items — without virtualization, thousands of DOM nodes will slow the browser. Only render items that are currently visible plus a buffer. Memory management: implement a maximum item cap and remove items from the top as new ones are added at the bottom (if memory is a concern). Loading state: show a skeleton or spinner in the sentinel area while fetching. Error handling: show a retry button if the fetch fails. Accessibility: announce to screen readers when new content loads. Use URL-based pagination as an alternative when SEO or shareability of scroll position is needed.

Q344. You need to share state between two sibling components that are far apart in the component tree. What approaches do you consider?
Answer: Options in order of increasing complexity: Lift state up to the nearest common ancestor — appropriate if the ancestor is close. React Context API — appropriate for relatively stable data (theme, user, locale). External state management (Zustand, Redux) — appropriate for complex state with many updates. URL state — for state that should be shareable and bookmarkable (filters, tabs, selected items). Consider the access pattern: if many components read it but few write, Context is fine. If many components write with high frequency, Context's re-render behavior will cause issues — use Zustand or split context into multiple smaller contexts. Prefer lifting state before reaching for external libraries — often the tree is not as deep as it seems.

Q345. A client asks you to make their existing server-rendered multi-page application work offline. What is your approach?
Answer: Progressive enhancement strategy. Add a service worker via Workbox. Implement a cache strategy: Cache-First for static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) — these change rarely and serving stale is acceptable. Network-First for HTML pages — users expect fresh content but fall back to cache when offline. Stale-While-Revalidate for semi-dynamic content. Add a Web App Manifest for installability. Create a custom offline page for uncached routes, explaining to users they are offline and which pages are available cached. Use Background Sync for form submissions that occur while offline — queue them and submit when connectivity returns. Test with Chrome DevTools offline mode and throttled connections. Measure impact with Lighthouse PWA audit.

## TOPIC 23: SCENARIO QUESTIONS — INTERMEDIATE

Q381. How would you implement a modal dialog that is fully accessible?
Answer: HTML structure: use a `<dialog>` element (native HTML5) or a div with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby` pointing to the modal title. Focus management: when the modal opens, move focus to the first focusable element or the modal container itself. Trap focus within the modal — users must not be able to tab outside. Return focus to the trigger element when the modal closes. Keyboard: close on Escape key. Scroll lock: prevent background scrolling while modal is open by adding `overflow: hidden` to body. Screen reader: use `aria-hidden="true"` on the background content when the modal is open, preventing screen readers from reading it. Close button: a clearly labeled close button accessible by keyboard. Animation: use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for users who prefer it.

Q382. You need to implement a search-as-you-type feature. How do you ensure good performance and user experience?
Answer: Debounce the search input (300ms) to avoid firing an API call on every keystroke. Show a loading indicator after debounce fires so users know a search is in progress. Implement optimistic UI — show previous results until new ones arrive. Handle race conditions: tag each request with a timestamp or use AbortController to cancel previous in-flight requests before making a new one. Keyboard navigation: allow arrow keys to navigate the suggestions list, Enter to select, Escape to close. Screen reader: use `role="combobox"`, `aria-autocomplete`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-activedescendant` for the input. Mark matching characters in suggestions. Implement a minimum character threshold (2-3 chars) before searching. Cache results with React Query or SWR to avoid repeated API calls for the same query.

Q383. How would you approach building a data table component with sorting, filtering, and pagination?
Answer: Component design: separate concerns — useSortedData hook, useFilteredData hook, usePaginatedData hook. Sorting: maintain sort state (column, direction), apply sorting to the data array, use `aria-sort` on column headers (ascending/descending/none). Filtering: debounce filter input, apply to all relevant columns, show result count. Pagination: calculate total pages, provide keyboard-accessible previous/next buttons, show current range. Performance: for large datasets (> 1000 rows) use virtual scrolling. Accessibility: use proper `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">` elements, not div-based layouts. Column resizing: add resize handles with proper cursor and ARIA. Consider TanStack Table (formerly React Table) for a headless, composable solution handling all these concerns with proper TypeScript support.

Q384. A developer on your team creates a React component that makes an API call in the render function body (not in useEffect). What is the problem and how do you fix it?
Answer: Critical bug. Making side effects in the render body causes the API call to fire on every render — including re-renders triggered by parent state changes, causing infinite loops or excessive network requests. React renders may be called multiple times in development (StrictMode double-invokes), and the rendering phase should be pure. Fix: move the API call to useEffect with the appropriate dependency array. For data fetching in particular, use React Query or SWR which handle caching, deduplication, and the useEffect lifecycle correctly. Explain the rule: render must be a pure function of props and state — no side effects. Side effects belong in useEffect, event handlers, or data fetching libraries.

Q385. How do you ensure a React application remains performant as it grows to thousands of components?
Answer: Architecture: keep state as local as possible — global state causes wide re-renders. Split large contexts into smaller, focused ones. Code splitting: lazy load route components and heavy third-party libraries. Bundle analysis: regularly audit bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer. Memoization: use React.memo for pure components receiving stable props. Use useMemo for expensive computations. Use useCallback for stable event handler references passed to memoized children. Virtual scrolling: for any list with more than 50-100 items. Image optimization: lazy load images below the fold, use WebP format, appropriate sizes. Performance monitoring: instrument with Web Vitals, track LCP/INP/CLS in production. React DevTools Profiler: identify re-render hotspots during development. Avoid premature optimization — profile first, then fix specific bottlenecks.

## TOPIC 25: ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS

Q401. How do you handle forms in React, including validation and submission?
Answer: Controlled components: manage form state with useState or useReducer, updating values via onChange handlers. Validation: use React Hook Form for performance (uncontrolled internally, minimal re-renders) with Zod or Yup for schema validation. Or build custom validation with error state managed alongside form values. UX patterns: validate on blur for initial feedback, validate on change after first submit attempt, show inline error messages below each field. Accessibility: associate errors with fields using aria-describedby, mark invalid fields with aria-invalid="true". Submission: disable submit button while submitting, handle errors from the server, show success feedback. File uploads: use FormData API. Complex forms: consider multi-step with progress indicator, save draft to localStorage. React Hook Form with Zod is the current best practice combining developer experience with performance.

Q402. How would you implement authentication flow in a Next.js application?
Answer: Use NextAuth.js (Auth.js) or Clerk for a complete solution. Manual implementation: login page POSTs credentials to a Next.js API route (or Server Action). Server validates credentials, creates a session. Store session: HttpOnly Secure cookie containing a JWT or session ID — never localStorage for sensitive auth tokens. Protected routes: Next.js Middleware checks the session cookie for each protected route — redirect to login if absent. Client-side: use a useUser or useSession hook reading from context or an API endpoint. Refresh tokens: short-lived access tokens (15min) refreshed silently using a long-lived HttpOnly refresh token. CSRF: use SameSite=Lax on cookies for most protection; add CSRF tokens for state-changing requests if SameSite=None is needed. OAuth: implement provider flows with proper state parameter for CSRF protection.

Q403. You are asked to implement a real-time collaborative feature (like Google Docs). What technology choices do you make?
Answer: WebSockets for bidirectional real-time communication — use socket.io for browser compatibility or native WebSocket API. Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for handling concurrent edits — Yjs is the leading CRDT library with React bindings. State synchronization: Yjs automatically merges concurrent operations without conflicts. Awareness: show other users' cursors and selections using Yjs Awareness protocol. Persistence: save document state to a database and load initial state when users join. Presence indicators: show who is currently viewing/editing. Offline support: buffer operations locally and sync when reconnected. Scaling: use a pub/sub system (Redis) to broadcast changes to all connected servers.

Q404. How do you approach internationalisation (i18n) in a React/Next.js application?
Answer: Library: next-intl or react-i18next for Next.js, i18next for generic React. Setup: extract all user-facing strings into JSON translation files per locale. Locale detection: detect from browser Accept-Language header, user preference, or URL path. URL structure: use path-based locales (/en/about, /fr/about) for SEO — Next.js has built-in i18n routing. Pluralization: use ICU message format for proper plural forms across languages. Date/number formatting: use Intl.DateTimeFormat and Intl.NumberFormat with the active locale — never hardcode date formats. RTL support: use CSS logical properties, `dir` attribute on html element, test with Arabic/Hebrew. Dynamic content: provide context strings for translators (what does this button do?). Testing: build a CI check that all strings in source files have translations in all supported locales.

Q405. A stakeholder wants to add a very complex data visualization to the application. How do you approach this?
Answer: Requirements gathering: what insights must the visualization communicate? Who is the audience? What interactions are needed? Library selection: D3.js for maximum flexibility and custom visualizations; Recharts or Victory for React-integrated chart components with good defaults; Chart.js for simpler use cases; Observable Plot for statistical visualizations. Performance: for large datasets (> 10k points), use canvas instead of SVG (D3 with canvas, WebGL for massive datasets). Virtualization: only render visible elements. Architecture: separate data transformation from rendering. Responsive: use ResizeObserver to react to container size changes, not just window resize. Accessibility: provide alt text, data tables as alternatives to visual charts, keyboard navigation for interactive elements. Progressive enhancement: show a meaningful view at every loading stage. Test on low-powered devices.

## TOPIC 26: MORE ADVANCED MCQ

Q406. What is the difference between `repaint` and `reflow` in browser rendering?
A) Same thing B) Reflow recalculates layout positions and sizes (expensive); repaint re-draws pixels without changing layout (less expensive) C) Reflow is faster D) Repaint causes reflow

Q407. What is layout thrashing?
A) A browser bug B) Repeatedly forcing the browser to recalculate layout by alternating between reading layout properties and making DOM mutations in a loop C) A memory issue D) A CSS problem
Answer: B — Fix: batch reads separately from writes, or use requestAnimationFrame.

Q408. What is `requestAnimationFrame`?
A) A frame rate limiter B) A browser API scheduling a callback before the next screen repaint — enables smooth 60fps animations synchronized with the display refresh rate C) A timer D) An animation library
Answer: B — Always use rAF for JavaScript animations, never setTimeout/setInterval.

Q409. What is the paint worklet in CSS Houdini?
A) A painter tool B) A CSS Houdini API enabling JavaScript to programmatically draw CSS background images and borders with full GPU acceleration C) A CSS animation D) A canvas API
Answer: B — Houdini exposes the browser's CSS rendering engine for custom styling.

Q410. What is `content-visibility`?
A) A visibility property B) A CSS property enabling browsers to skip rendering of off-screen content entirely (layout, paint, compositing) until the content is near the viewport C) Lazy loading D) A display property
Answer: B — `content-visibility: auto` can dramatically improve initial render performance for long pages.

Q411. What is the Speculation Rules API?
A) A testing API B) A browser API enabling developers to declare which navigations to prerender or prefetch speculatively, enabling near-instant page transitions C) A cache API D) A prefetch API
Answer: B — More powerful than `<link rel="prefetch">` — can fully prerender the next page.

Q412. What is CSS Cascade Layers?
A) CSS z-index B) An `@layer` feature giving developers explicit control over the order of specificity layers — enabling framework styles to be overridden predictably C) A Sass feature D) CSS specificity
Answer: B — `@layer base, components, utilities` — higher layers win over lower ones regardless of specificity.

## TOPIC 27: FINAL SCENARIOS

Q421. How would you implement a dark mode feature in a React application?
Answer: CSS approach: define a color palette using CSS custom properties on `:root` and override them with a `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute. Toggle: use a useTheme hook storing preference in localStorage and syncing with the `data-theme` attribute on the html element. System preference: use `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` to detect system preference as the initial default. Hydration: in Next.js, read the theme from a cookie in Server Components to avoid flash of incorrect theme during SSR. Tailwind: use the `dark:` variant with `darkMode: 'class'` configuration. Images: provide separate images for dark mode using `<picture>` with a `prefers-color-scheme` media query. SVGs: use `currentColor` so SVG icons adapt to text color. Testing: test both themes in Storybook.

Q422. How do you implement secure file upload in the frontend?
Answer: Validation before upload: check file type (MIME type and extension), file size limit, and number of files client-side. Never trust client-side validation alone — validate on the server too. Upload approach: for small files, base64 encode and include in JSON body. For large files, use multipart/form-data or — better — get a presigned URL from the server and upload directly to S3/GCS from the browser, avoiding server bandwidth costs. Progress: use XMLHttpRequest or fetch with ReadableStream for upload progress. Security: strip metadata from images server-side (EXIF data may contain GPS coordinates). Scan uploads with antivirus. Store files outside the web root or in cloud storage — never a public directory. Generate unpredictable file names to prevent guessing. Show preview for images using URL.createObjectURL() — always call URL.revokeObjectURL() after use to free memory.

Q423. Describe your approach to frontend error monitoring and debugging in production.
Answer: Error monitoring: integrate Sentry or Datadog frontend for automatic exception capture including stack traces, user context, and breadcrumbs. Source maps uploaded to Sentry (never public) for readable stack traces. Custom error boundaries in React catching and reporting component errors. Performance monitoring: Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) reported via web-vitals library to your analytics or Sentry. Real User Monitoring (RUM): measure actual user experience in production. Logging: structured console logging in development that is stripped in production. Feature flags: use feature flags to gradually roll out changes and quickly disable problematic features. Debugging production: source maps accessible only to authenticated devs. Replay sessions with tools like Sentry Session Replay or LogRocket for understanding exactly what a user did before an error. Alerting: PagerDuty alerts for error rate spikes above threshold.

Q424. You are given a legacy jQuery application to modernize. What is your strategy?
Answer: Incremental modernization — do not attempt a full rewrite. Phase 1: Baseline. Add linting, testing, and build tooling without changing functionality. Document existing behavior. Phase 2: Extract utilities. Move jQuery utility functions to vanilla JS or lodash equivalents. Remove jQuery where it is being used just for simple DOM queries (document.querySelector replaces $). Phase 3: Componentize. Identify UI sections and convert them to framework components (React) incrementally. Use the Strangler Fig pattern — new features in React, old features in jQuery. Mount React components into existing jQuery page sections. Phase 4: State management. Replace global jQuery state with a proper state management solution. Phase 5: Full migration. Once most of the page is React components, remove jQuery entirely. Key principle: ship continuously, never have a feature freeze for a big bang rewrite.

Q425. How do you ensure code quality and consistency across a large frontend team?
Answer: Automated tooling: ESLint with shared config enforcing rules automatically. Prettier for consistent formatting — no style debates. TypeScript for type safety reducing entire classes of bugs. Husky pre-commit hooks running lint and type-check before every commit. CI/CD: run linting, type-checking, unit tests, and E2E tests on every pull request — block merges on failures. Code review: PR templates with checklists (accessibility, performance, tests, docs). Component documentation: Storybook as the source of truth for component usage. Design tokens: shared token system ensuring design consistency. Architecture decisions: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) documenting why choices were made. Onboarding: thorough documentation of conventions, testing approaches, and component patterns. Regular team review: retrospectives on code quality issues, updating standards as the team learns.

## TOPIC 30: FINAL SCENARIOS AND CONCEPTS

Q461. How do you approach performance testing and monitoring in a frontend application?
Answer: Development: run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools regularly. Set performance budgets in build configuration — fail CI if bundle size exceeds threshold. Use `web-vitals` library capturing Core Web Vitals in production. Production monitoring: send Web Vitals to analytics (GA4 or custom endpoint) — measure actual user experience, not just synthetic tests. Real User Monitoring (RUM): track p75 and p95 percentiles, not just averages — slow users matter. Synthetic monitoring: scheduled Lighthouse CI runs from multiple locations detecting regressions. Error budgets: define acceptable LCP/INP/CLS thresholds per page. Performance regression testing: block deployments that significantly worsen Core Web Vitals. Profiling: use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for specific interaction profiling. Tooling: SpeedCurve, Calibre, or WebPageTest for historical tracking of performance metrics.

Q462. Explain how you would implement a design token system for a large application.
Answer: Tokens are the foundation: define primitive tokens (raw values) — `color.blue.500: #3b82f6`, `space.4: 16px`. Then semantic tokens mapping primitives to intent — `color.background.primary: {color.blue.500}`. Implementation: store tokens in a central JSON/YAML file (Style Dictionary is the standard tool for transformation). Generate: platform-specific outputs — CSS custom properties, JS objects, Sass variables, iOS Swift constants, Android XML. Usage: components reference semantic tokens only (`var(--color-background-primary)`), never primitive values directly. Theming: swap semantic token values per theme without changing components. Dark mode: redefine semantic tokens under a `[data-theme="dark"]` selector. Tooling: Figma tokens plugin syncing design and code tokens. Governance: design and engineering review token additions together to maintain semantic coherence.

Q463. How would you implement keyboard navigation for a custom dropdown component?
Answer: Following the ARIA Combobox pattern. HTML: input with `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-controls` pointing to the listbox. Listbox with `role="listbox"`, options with `role="option"`, `aria-selected`. Keyboard interactions: Down Arrow opens the list and moves focus to the first option (or next option if already open). Up Arrow moves to the previous option. Enter/Space selects the focused option and closes. Escape closes without selecting. Home/End moves to first/last option. Type-ahead: typing characters jumps to the first option starting with that character. Focus management: when the list opens, focus moves to the currently selected option (or first option). When closed, focus returns to the input/button. Prevent default on all these keys to avoid browser scroll. Tab closes the dropdown and moves to next focusable element.

Q464. How do you approach bundle size optimization for a React application?
Answer: Audit first: run `npx webpack-bundle-analyzer` or Vite's bundle visualizer to see what is taking space. Quick wins: replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives (moment.js → date-fns, lodash → native methods or lodash-es with tree-shaking, large icon libraries → individual icon imports). Code splitting: lazy load all route components, lazy load heavy modal/drawer content. Dynamic imports: `import('./heavyModule')` on demand rather than at startup. Tree-shaking: ensure all imports use named exports from ES modules (`import { specific } from 'lib'` not `import lib from 'lib'`). Externalize: serve React from CDN with importmaps in multi-app architectures. Compression: enable Brotli compression on the server. Images: use WebP/AVIF, implement srcset, lazy load below the fold. Set budget: enforce max bundle size in CI with `bundlesize` package.

Q465. What is your approach to implementing a real-time notification system in a frontend application?
Answer: Technology choice: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for one-way server-to-client notifications — simpler than WebSockets, works over HTTP, automatic reconnection. WebSockets for bidirectional real-time features. Long polling as a fallback for restrictive network environments. SSE implementation: `const es = new EventSource('/notifications')`, listen to message events. Reconnection: SSE reconnects automatically; track the last event ID for recovery. Notification types: in-app notifications (toast, bell icon badge), push notifications via Push API + service worker for background delivery. State management: maintain a notifications list in global state, mark as read/unread, persist to localStorage. UI: toast notifications with auto-dismiss (accessible with role="status" or role="alert"), persistent notification center. Badge count: show unread count in favicon (Canvas API) or page title. Reconnection handling: show an indicator when disconnected from the notification stream.

# PART 2: ROUND TYPE QUESTIONS (Q501–Q640)

---

## ROUND TYPE: SCENARIO QUESTIONS

Q501. You are building a product listing page that currently loads 500 products at once and is slow. How do you fix it?
Answer: Multiple strategies depending on the use case. Pagination: show 20-50 products per page with page number navigation — simplest solution, great for SEO, predictable. Infinite scroll: load the next batch when the user scrolls near the bottom using IntersectionObserver — good for exploration interfaces, worse for finding a specific item. Virtual scrolling: render only the items currently visible using react-virtual or react-window — render all 500 but only paint 20-30 at once. The DOM stays small. Backend pagination: never send 500 items from the server — implement proper cursor or offset pagination in the API. Image optimization: lazy load product images below the fold. Skeleton loading: show placeholder cards immediately while data loads. Filter/search: let users narrow results so the list is manageable. Measure: profile with Chrome DevTools before and after to quantify improvement.

Q502. A client asks you to build a form that works offline and submits when connectivity is restored. How do you implement this?
Answer: Service worker with Background Sync. When the form is submitted offline: catch the failed fetch in a service worker, store the form data in IndexedDB, register a sync event `registration.sync.register('submit-form')`. When connectivity is restored, the browser fires the `sync` event in the service worker. The service worker reads pending form data from IndexedDB, attempts the submission, and removes the data on success. UI feedback: detect `navigator.onLine` for immediate feedback, but do not rely on it for reliability (it can be inaccurate). Show a clear "Your submission will be sent when online" message. Cache the form page itself so it renders offline. Test thoroughly — edge cases include the user submitting multiple times before connectivity is restored (deduplicate with a unique ID per submission).

Q503. Your single-page application takes 8 seconds to become interactive on a 3G connection. What do you do?
Answer: 8 seconds is catastrophically slow — systematic optimization. Measure: run WebPageTest on a 3G throttled connection to identify the specific bottlenecks. Initial bundle: analyze with bundle analyzer. Split all routes with React.lazy. Remove unused dependencies. Eliminate large libraries (moment, lodash). JavaScript parsing: large JS bundles take significant time to parse on low-powered mobile CPUs. Use the Coverage tab in DevTools to find unused code. Critical path: inline critical CSS in the HTML head. Defer non-critical scripts with async/defer. Preload key resources with `<link rel="preload">`. Server: enable compression (Brotli), HTTP/2, edge caching. Images: lazy load below fold, WebP format, appropriate sizes. Consider SSR: render HTML on the server so users see content before JS loads. Target: aim for under 3 seconds on 3G for LCP. Add performance budget to CI to prevent regression.

Q504. How do you handle a situation where your React application must support Internet Explorer 11?
Answer: Important context: IE11 was officially retired in 2022. But if required: Add Babel polyfills (core-js) for modern JavaScript features. Configure Babel targets to include IE11. Add CSS vendor prefixes with Autoprefixer. Avoid: ES modules, CSS Grid (limited IE11 support), CSS custom properties, CSS Grid's `gap` property, modern browser APIs (IntersectionObserver, Fetch — polyfill these). Test in a Windows VM with IE11. Use IE11-compatible React patterns (class components if hooks have issues). Be explicit with the client about the cost — IE11 support significantly increases bundle size, development complexity, and limits feature capabilities. Strongly recommend establishing an EOL date for IE11 support aligned with Microsoft's official end of support.

Q505. You are building a dashboard showing real-time stock prices updating every second. How do you architect the frontend?
Answer: Data delivery: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for push-based price updates — avoid polling. Technology: React with a dedicated WebSocket hook managing connection lifecycle, reconnection, and cleanup. State management: use Zustand or React Context for the prices store. Performance: 1-second updates for potentially hundreds of symbols is demanding. Batch UI updates using `startTransition` to keep the page responsive. Use `useMemo` to avoid recomputing derived data on every tick. Virtual scroll if showing many symbols simultaneously. Only re-render cells that changed — use React.memo on individual price cells. Throttle UI updates: update the data layer every second but only render at 60fps using requestAnimationFrame. Chart: use a canvas-based charting library (lightweight-charts by TradingView) for tick-level performance. Cleanup: properly close WebSocket on unmount. Handle disconnection with automatic reconnection and a visual indicator.

Q506. How do you implement a drag-and-drop kanban board in React?
Answer: Library choice: dnd-kit is the modern recommendation — accessible, touch-friendly, and performant. Avoid react-beautiful-dnd (deprecated). Implementation: define drag sources (cards) and drop targets (columns and positions within columns). Drag state: track the active dragged item ID and which column/position the pointer is over. Optimistic updates: update the UI immediately on drop, then sync to the server. Collision detection: use dnd-kit's collision detection algorithms for correct hover behavior. Keyboard accessibility: full keyboard drag-and-drop following the ARIA drag-and-drop pattern — Space to lift, arrow keys to move, Space/Enter to drop, Escape to cancel. Announce actions to screen readers using a live region. Animation: use CSS transforms for smooth animations during drag — animate the overlay card position and the drop area indicator. Persistence: save order to the server on drop via an API call.

Q507. You need to optimize a React application's Time to Interactive (TTI) from 12 seconds to under 3 seconds. What is your strategy?
Answer: Systematic approach. Measure: WebPageTest waterfall diagram, Chrome DevTools Coverage tab, Performance tab for long tasks. JavaScript reduction: code split aggressively — every route lazy loaded, every modal and heavy component lazy loaded. Analyze bundle — remove or replace heavy dependencies. Defer non-critical JavaScript with async/defer. Critical rendering path: inline above-the-fold CSS. Preload key JavaScript chunks. Server-side rendering: render initial HTML on the server — SSR + hydration means users see content before JS is fully loaded. Reduce main thread blocking: break up long tasks into chunks using scheduler.yield() or setTimeout. Move heavy computation to Web Workers. Third-party scripts: audit every third-party script (analytics, chat, ads) — they frequently account for 50%+ of blocking time. Lazy load them after TTI. React: eliminate unnecessary renders at the top of the component tree.

Q508. A major refactor replaced the CSS framework from Bootstrap to Tailwind. QA reports that spacing and sizing is inconsistent across the app. What do you do?
Answer: Visual regression testing: implement screenshot comparison testing (Playwright with pixelmatch, or Chromatic for Storybook) to catch layout regressions automatically going forward. Systematic audit: create a grid of all components in Storybook and review each. Cross-browser test matrix. Design token audit: verify Tailwind's spacing scale matches the design system's expected values. Create a mapping document: Bootstrap `px-3` ≡ Tailwind `px-3` (12px) — verify each component was correctly converted. Hotfixes: address critical user-facing inconsistencies immediately. Document: create a migration guide showing Bootstrap → Tailwind equivalences for future reference. Prevention: add visual regression to CI pipeline. Lesson: major CSS refactors should always include comprehensive visual regression testing with approval workflow for intentional changes.

## ROUND TYPE: ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEM DESIGN

Q509. Design the frontend architecture for a large-scale e-commerce application.
Answer: Framework: Next.js App Router for SSR/SSG/ISR — product pages statically generated for SEO, personalized content dynamically rendered. Routing: file-based with dynamic segments for categories and products. Data fetching: React Server Components fetch product data directly, Client Components handle cart and user state. State: Zustand for cart and user session, React Query for server state synchronization. Performance: Next.js Image for all product images, ISR with 60-second revalidation for product data, Edge Middleware for A/B testing and geo-based redirects. Search: Algolia integration with instant search UI components. Checkout: isolated from main app with stricter CSP and PCI compliance boundaries. Design system: Radix UI primitives with custom Tailwind-based styling. Testing: Playwright for critical paths (product search, add to cart, checkout), React Testing Library for components. CDN: Vercel Edge Network or CloudFront for global asset delivery. Monitoring: Sentry for errors, Core Web Vitals tracking per page type.

Q510. Design a component library that will be shared across 5 different React applications.
Answer: Foundation: Vite library mode for building, TypeScript for type safety, CSS Modules or Tailwind for styling. Package: publish to npm (private registry for internal use). Monorepo: Turborepo or Nx managing the component library alongside consuming apps. Design tokens: Style Dictionary generating CSS custom properties and JS constants from a single token file. Component API: Radix UI primitives as headless foundation — compose with styling on top. Documentation: Storybook deployed to a shared URL — single source of truth for designers and developers. Versioning: semantic versioning, CHANGELOG with every release, codemods for breaking changes. Testing: unit tests for logic, visual regression in Storybook with Chromatic. Accessibility: axe-core in tests, ARIA patterns from ARIA Authoring Practices Guide. Bundle optimization: tree-shakeable ES module build, no bundled peer dependencies (React). CI/CD: automated releases on merge to main, preview Storybooks on every PR.

Q511. Design the state management architecture for a complex React enterprise dashboard.
Answer: Layered state architecture. Server state: React Query for all API data — handles caching, refetching, optimistic updates, and loading states. No manual useEffect for data fetching. UI state: React Context for low-frequency shared state — current theme, user preferences, active modal. Component state: useState and useReducer for component-local state — forms, open/closed toggles. URL state: search params for state that should be bookmarkable — filters, pagination, selected tab. Global client state: Zustand for application-level state that does not fit above categories — notification queue, WebSocket connection state. Data normalization: normalize API responses (or use RTK Query's normalization) to prevent data duplication. Optimistic updates: React Query mutation with `onMutate` for instant feedback. Avoid: putting server data in Redux/Zustand manually — that is React Query's job. Rule: state should live at the lowest level that meets its needs.

## ROUND TYPE: CONCEPT MCQ — RAPID FIRE

Q521. What is the difference between `==` null check and `=== null` check?
A) No difference B) `== null` is true for both null and undefined (useful); `=== null` only matches null C) Both are the same D) `==` is more strict
Answer: B — `value == null` is a common shorthand for "null or undefined".

Q522. What does `Array.isArray([])` return?
A) false B) true C) undefined D) TypeError
Answer: B — More reliable than `typeof []` which returns 'object'.

Q523. What is the output of `typeof null`?
A) 'null' B) 'object' C) 'undefined' D) 'boolean'
Answer: B — This is a well-known JavaScript bug that cannot be fixed without breaking the web.

Q524. What does CSS `outline: none` do and when is it dangerous?
A) Removes all borders B) Removes the focus indicator — dangerous for accessibility as keyboard users lose visual feedback of which element is focused C) Improves performance D) It is always safe
Answer: B — Never use outline:none without providing an alternative focus style.

Q525. What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JSON serialization?
A) No difference B) `JSON.stringify` converts `undefined` values to nothing (omits the key); `null` is preserved as `null` in JSON C) Both become null D) Both are omitted
Answer: B — `JSON.stringify({ a: undefined, b: null })` → `{"b":null}`.

Q526. What does `display: contents` do?
A) Shows hidden content B) Removes the element's box from the layout while keeping its children — useful for semantic wrappers that should not affect grid/flex layout C) Makes content visible D) Displays content inline
Answer: B — The element participates in semantics but not layout.

Q527. What is the difference between `em` and `ch` CSS units?
A) No difference B) `em` is relative to the current element's font-size; `ch` is the width of the "0" character in the current font — useful for input sizing C) ch is absolute D) em is for width
Answer: B — `width: 20ch` sizes an input for approximately 20 characters.

Q528. What does `position: absolute` position relative to?
A) The viewport B) The nearest ancestor with `position` set to anything other than `static` C) The document root D) The parent element
Answer: B — If no positioned ancestor exists, it positions relative to the initial containing block (viewport).

## ROUND TYPE: MOCK INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Q551. Interviewer: Explain what happens when you type a URL in the browser and press Enter.
Answer: DNS resolution: browser checks DNS cache, then OS cache, then queries DNS resolver to resolve the domain to an IP address. TCP connection: browser establishes a TCP connection with the server via three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK). TLS handshake: for HTTPS, TLS negotiation establishes an encrypted connection. HTTP request: browser sends an HTTP GET request with headers (Host, User-Agent, Accept, cookies). Server processing: server processes the request, queries databases if needed, generates a response. HTTP response: server sends HTML with status code and response headers (Content-Type, Cache-Control, Set-Cookie). Browser parsing: browser receives the HTML, begins parsing, builds the DOM tree. As CSS links are encountered, they are fetched and CSSOM is built. JavaScript files are fetched and executed (blocking unless async/defer). Rendering: DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree → Layout (positions and sizes) → Paint (pixels to screen) → Composite. Additional resources: images, fonts, and scripts are fetched as they are encountered.

Q552. Interviewer: What is your approach to debugging a complex React state management bug?
Answer: Systematic isolation. First, reproduce the bug reliably and document the exact steps. React DevTools: check the component tree and see current state values. React DevTools Profiler: identify which components re-render and when. Console logging: temporarily add logging at state update points to trace the data flow. Binary search: comment out half the code path to narrow down where the incorrect state enters. Redux DevTools (if using Redux): replay the action sequence and inspect state at each step. For context bugs: check if Provider is above the consuming component. For stale closure bugs: check if useEffect/useCallback dependencies are complete. For unexpected renders: check if reference equality is causing false re-renders (objects created on each render). React StrictMode: double-invokes renders in development — useful for catching impure renders. Simplify: extract the problematic logic into a minimal reproduction case.

Q553. Interviewer: You join a team maintaining a large React codebase with poor performance. What is your 30-60-90 day plan?
Answer: Days 1-30: Understand and measure. Set up proper performance monitoring — Web Vitals in production, Lighthouse CI in the build pipeline. Identify the 3 worst-performing pages by LCP, INP, and CLS. Profile the worst offender with Chrome DevTools Performance tab. Document current baseline metrics. Understand the codebase — component architecture, state management approach, data fetching patterns, build configuration. Identify the most impactful and least risky improvements. Days 30-60: Quick wins. Fix the top 3 issues identified in profiling — typically: images without dimensions (CLS), large synchronous JavaScript (INP), render-blocking resources (LCP). Add React.memo to the most frequently re-rendering components. Implement code splitting for the largest routes. Update bundle analyzer and remove obviously unused dependencies. Days 60-90: Systemic improvements. Migrate data fetching to React Query, eliminating waterfall requests. Implement virtual scrolling for any long lists. Establish performance review in PR process. Educate the team on the patterns causing the issues found.

Q554. Interviewer: How do you ensure the accessibility of a component you are building?
Answer: Start from the beginning — accessibility is not a bolt-on. HTML semantics: use the correct HTML element for the purpose (button for buttons, not div). The correct element provides keyboard access, ARIA roles, and browser behavior for free. Interactive elements: ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible (focusable, operable with Enter/Space). Do not use non-semantic elements for interaction. ARIA: add ARIA only when native HTML semantics are insufficient. Follow the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for complex widgets (combobox, dialog, tabs). Focus management: manage focus correctly for modals, slide-overs, and dynamic content. Color and contrast: verify 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Do not use color as the only differentiator. Text alternatives: alt text for images, labels for form fields, captions for videos. Test with a screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows) — reading about ARIA is insufficient for understanding how it actually works. Use axe-core in automated tests to catch programmatic issues.

Q555. Interviewer: Describe a technically challenging frontend problem you solved.
How to answer: Prepare a specific story covering: the technical context (what system, what constraints), the specific challenge (performance bottleneck, complex interaction, cross-browser issue, accessibility requirement), your diagnostic process (how you identified the root cause), the solution you implemented (specific technical details), and the measurable outcome (load time reduced by X%, error rate dropped from Y% to Z%). Demonstrate depth of technical knowledge, systematic problem-solving, and clear communication. The story should be something you personally solved, not your team — use "I" not "we" for your specific contributions.

Q556. Interviewer: What is your philosophy on writing CSS in 2024?
Answer: Utility-first where appropriate: Tailwind CSS for the majority of styling reduces cognitive overhead, enforces design system constraints, and eliminates the naming problem. CSS for customization: CSS custom properties for theming and design tokens — the cascade and inheritance make them powerful for theming across components. Avoid over-engineering: CSS Modules or simple BEM for component-specific styles when Tailwind is insufficient. Avoid CSS-in-JS with runtime overhead for new projects — the performance cost is hard to justify. Modern CSS is powerful: container queries, cascade layers, `has()`, `clamp()`, and logical properties reduce the need for JavaScript. Separate concerns: do not use CSS for logic (complex state management via CSS only gets messy). Prioritize: mobile-first, performance (minimize unused CSS), accessibility (focus styles, reduced motion), and maintainability over cleverness.

Q557. Interviewer: How do you approach testing in a frontend project?
Answer: Testing philosophy: test behavior, not implementation. Tests should tell you what broke and why, not just that something broke. Test pyramid: many unit tests for pure utility functions. Component tests using React Testing Library for interactive components — test them like a user would. Integration tests for complex multi-component flows. A small number of E2E tests covering critical business flows (auth, checkout, core feature). Tools: Vitest for unit and component tests (faster than Jest). React Testing Library for component testing. Playwright for E2E. MSW for API mocking. Priorities: highest-value tests first — authentication, checkout, core feature. Not every component needs tests. What to avoid: testing implementation details (which state variable is set). Snapshot tests for everything. Tests that only pass when the application actually works (tautological tests). CI integration: all tests run on every PR, block merges on failure. Target meaningful coverage, not 100% — untested complex logic matters more than tested trivial code.

Q558. Interviewer: Explain the React component lifecycle in hooks.
Answer: Mounting: The component renders for the first time. `useState` initializer runs. JSX is returned and the DOM is updated. `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously before the browser paints. `useEffect` with empty dependency array `[]` runs after the first paint — equivalent to componentDidMount. Updating: A state or prop change triggers a re-render. The component function runs again. React diffs the new JSX with the previous render. DOM updates are applied. `useLayoutEffect` cleanup runs, then the new `useLayoutEffect` runs. `useEffect` cleanup runs for effects with changed dependencies, then the new `useEffect` runs. Unmounting: The component is removed from the DOM. All `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` cleanup functions run — equivalent to componentWillUnmount. Key insight: `useEffect` with dependencies `[a, b]` runs when `a` or `b` changes. The cleanup function runs before the next execution and on unmount. Returning a cleanup from every useEffect that adds subscriptions or event listeners is critical for preventing memory leaks.

Q559. Interviewer: What is your approach to code review for frontend PRs?
Answer: Purpose: code review improves quality, spreads knowledge, and builds shared standards — not just finding bugs. What I look for: correctness — does the code do what it claims? Are edge cases handled? Accessibility — are new interactive elements keyboard accessible? Are ARIA roles correct? Performance — any obvious render performance issues? Unnecessary re-renders? Large images without optimization? Security — XSS risks from innerHTML with user data? Client-side secrets? Type safety — TypeScript types correct and meaningful (not overuse of any)? Tests — are critical paths tested? Do tests test behavior or implementation? Code clarity — will someone understand this in 6 months? Are complex sections documented? Consistency — does it follow established patterns in the codebase? What I do not review: formatting — that is Prettier's job. Minor naming preferences — these are not worth blocking a PR. I approve if it is correct and safe, and communicate suggestions as optional improvements. I leave PR comments as learning opportunities, not criticism.

Q560. Interviewer: What is the most important thing you have learned about frontend development in the last year?
How to answer: Authentic answers are most compelling. Strong current topics: React Server Components fundamentally changing the data fetching model; the Web Platform catching up to frameworks (Container Queries, View Transitions, Popover API); AI-assisted development (GitHub Copilot) and how to use it effectively; the importance of Core Web Vitals as real business metrics; Signals as a reactivity model appearing across frameworks (Preact Signals, SolidJS, Angular Signals). Demonstrate genuine curiosity and that you stay current with the rapidly evolving frontend ecosystem. Tie the learning to practical impact — "I learned X, which changed how I Y, resulting in Z."
